However, there was one issue: the flight captain was passed out in the cockpit, perhaps due to intoxication. On Saturday, police in Calgary, Alberta, detained pilot Miroslav Gronych 37 and accused him with two crimes. This is a new one, and it had a considerable chance of causing serious harm if the pilot had been allowed to fly the plane. At a press conference, Calgary Police Service Staff Sgt Paul Stacey remarked There are so many checks and balances in place that it doesnt surprise me.He was apprehended before the jet could leave the gate. Nonetheless, Calgary Police Service traffic and airport unit commander Inspector Ken Thrower said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin investigating how the pilot was able to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while clearly inebriated. Mr Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while intoxicated and having care and control of an aircraft with a blood alcohol concentration of more than 80 milligrams per 100 milliliters. He was a little buzzed. Sergeant Stacey continued, Its unthinkable that the pilot would have followed us.Pilots are not allowed to drink or use drugs within eight hours of a flight, according to Transport Canada regulations. Sunwing Airlines, a Toronto-based carrier, noticed the pilots strange behavior and contacted the authorities. They discovered the pilot slumped in the captains seat, considerably impaired by alcohol. Transport Canada, which did not reply to demands for comment, is reportedly initiating a second investigation that will likely result in additional penalties, according to Sergeant Stacey. the cops stated Mr Gronych is from Slovenia, according to Inspector Thrower, and is in Canada on a work visa.On Thursday, he will return to court. The flight eventually took off with a new crew after some delays. Requests for comment from Sunwing were not returned.

Before you follow their advice, have a look at how well such portfolios performed in 2016. The stock portfolios they advised you to buy performed substantially worse than the stock market overall. The findings support what many personal finance professionals advise. Invest in a wide index mutual fund. More on this from The New York Times Your Money columnist here. The broad S P stock index climbed by 9.5 percent in 2016. If you invested in Forbes 2016 list, though, your money climbed by around 7%. Kiplingers was around half the price. A list published on the Money magazine website drew a lot of attention. Barrons returned 49% and 49%, respectively. CNBCs list scored a little better than the rest, with a score of 106 percent. During the same time period, though, Vanguards Total Stock index fund returned 12.5 percent. Even when we assumed that all dividends were reinvested, none of the funds outperformed the widely held index fund. Theres nothing wrong with these lists if youre just looking for ideas for companies to look into. On practically every list, there were some genuine winners. Goldman Sachs is a financial services firm. Kennametal Ellie Mae is a character in the film Ellie Mae Douglas Dynamics is a company that specializes in the Burlington Stores is a retailer in Burlington, Vermont. Some of those companies may be unfamiliar to you, so its a good place to start looking for inspiration.However, the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to invest incorrectly. Unsophisticated investors are being enticed to hold a plethora of stocks. However, even when equities are recommended by expert money managers and screened through some of the top financial journalists, they do not outperform the market averages. The best piece of advice is still the same. If you have some spare cash, try your hand at a few stocks that you can closely monitor. Its easier to track and respond if you keep things simple, but for the rest of us, index funds are a good investment.They are less expensive than stocks or other mutual funds. They take out the majority of the emotion from your decision-making process, which is the source of many poor choices.
